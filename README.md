# ransom
Problem statement:

You have kidnapped your neighbor's dog. Now you have to write a ransom note to him. But since he is your neighbor he knows your handwriting so you will have to cut words from the newspaper and create the ransom note.

To determine if you can prepare the ransom note when a newspaper and the ransom message is provided.

I have taken test input text for both, ransom text input and newspaper text input. You can replace input text as per your requirements. 

Happy Coding ! :)
